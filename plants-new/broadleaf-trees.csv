"broadleaf tree, broadleaf shrub",Salix spp.,willows,,Salicaceae,WI,"Floodplains, marshes, and wet edge habitats.","Shrubs or trees, often growing on wet soils, and usually with strong but thin and flexible branches and twigs.  Larger trees often have trunks that fork near the base. The leaves are alternate, simple, linear or elongated, though some species may have wider elliptic leaves. Leaf color varies from green, to yellowish-green, to bluish or whitish green.  Often the leaves are a lighter color on the underside.  Margins may be entire or frequently toothed along the lower half of the leaf.  Buds are lateral; no true terminal bud is present.  Stipules are present, but not always very conspicuous and may fall off.  The buds are covered by a single bud scale.  The plants are dioecious. Male trees bear flowers on hairy catkins that often open prior to leaf flush in spring (think of the soft catkins of pussy willows).  Female catkins produce fuzzy seeds that are wind dispersed.","By wildlife:  Several species of insect larvae feed on willow leaves.  Thickets of willow provide cover for wildlife.

The leaves are variably shaped, usually ovate or obovate, with a lobed, coarsely toothed, or finely toothed margin.  They are alternate, and spirally arranged on short shoots or along the twigs.  The flowers are small but pretty, radially symmetrical with 5 usually white to pink petals.  The fruit is a small berry-like pome that resembles a tiny apple. The most common type of bark is smooth grey in young individuals, developing shallow longitudinal fissures with narrow ridges in older trees.","By wildlife:  The flowers attract many insects and the fruits are eaten by birds and mammals.
By humans:  Ornamental.  The hard wood can be used for tool handles or fenceposts. The fruit can be made into preserves or wine.","Small bushy trees with sharp, smooth thorns.","Crab apples (Malus) have dull, bumpy thorns.

broadleaf tree,Malus ioensis,Prairie crabapple,Iowa crabapple,Rosaceae,WI,Found on drier soils in prairies and forest borders in S WI.,"Large shrub or small tree about 10-25' tall with short trunk and spreading crown.  The crooked branches have dull, thorn-like spur shoots (or short shoots) upon which leaves are clustered.  The bark is mostly gray, scaly, and thin with shallow fissures. The short lateral spurs come off at a right-angles to the branches. Young twigs are densely pubescent.  The alternate, simple leaves are 1½–4"" long and 1-2"" wide, ovate or elliptic in shape, sometimes with a few shallow irregular lobes. The upper leaf surface is medium green and glabrous (although may be hairy when very young), while the lower leaf surface is pale green and hairy. The petioles are ½–1½"" long, densely pubescent, and more or less whitened.  Clusters of 2-6 flowers develop from the tips of twigs and short shoots. The flowers are 1¼–2"" across on a hairy pedicel; each flower consists of 5 light pink to white petals, a green cup-shaped calyx with 5 teeth, 10-20 stamens with yellow anthers, and a pistil with 5 styles. The widely spreading petals are oval in shape, except they taper abruptly to become narrow at their bases. The calyx and its teeth are pubescent on both the exterior and interior surfaces; the teeth are linear-lanceolate to narrowly triangular in shape. The large flower buds are usually bright pink. The fragrant blooms are present for a few weeks in late spring.  The ripe fruits (pomes) are greenish-yellow, 1–1¼"" across, like small apples.  The seeds are dark-brown, flattened, and tear-drop shaped.
