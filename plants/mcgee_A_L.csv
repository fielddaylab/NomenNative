Common yarrow,Achillea millefolium,Achillea,millefolium,"Aster, Daisy (Asteraceae)",Native,Native - potentially invasive,1,"With very feathery and fern-like leaves, yarrow is an interesting specimen in the prairie.  Usually around 1-2 feet tall, yarrow has a flat topped inflorescence.  Its stems, leaves and flowers are very fragrant when crushed.  Yarrow is common throughout most of the country and it spreads rhizomatously. 
Leaves are evenly distributed along the stem, with the leaves near the middle and bottom of the stem being the largest. The leaves have varying degrees of hairiness (pubescence). The leaves are 5–20 cm long, bipinnate or tripinnate, almost feathery, and arranged spirally on the stems. The leaves grow towards the top of the stem and are more or less clasping.
","Smell the leaves for a strong medicinal scent (beware, it can cause allergic reactions in some people).  Very fernlike and feathery leaves (more so than Queen Anne’s lace) are a good indicator trait. ","The plant has been extensively used as medicine since ancient times.  Its healing properties are well known for any herbalist or survivalist. Among the many ailments it has been used to treat are broken bones, bruises, wounds, sores, eczema, stomachaches, colds, fevers, childbirth and most famously, as a treatment to stop bleeding.  A yarrow tincture on a tissue stuffed up the nostril can be used to stop a bloody nose.",Some people have allergic reactions to yarrow.  Leaves can be used to make a pleasant tea.,"Human use of the plant can be traced back to its discovery in Shanidar Cave in Iraq dating back almost 100,000 years.
Yarrow was named after Achilles, the Greek mythical figure who used it to stop the bleeding wounds of his soldiers.
It was used in counter-magical practices to 'drive out the  devil' of those who had become possessed.
Other common names like nosebleed plant and soldier’s woundwort, are testaments to its famous ability to stop bleeding.
Campers take note, The leaves and stems are collected into a smudge and burnt to keep mosquitoes away!
Seeds were used as a perfume and bath powder.  
Was once used by Native Americans as bait to hunt lynx. 
The Potawatomi created smoke by heating the seeds to keep away witches and evil spirits.  
The plant was placed inside a fish cavity as a preservative. 
Swedes used yarrow instead of hops to make beer and considered the beer to be more intoxicating.
Said to be a favorite snack for bears.

Garlic mustard,Alliaria petiolata,Alliaria,petiolata,Mustard (Brassicaceae),Introduced,naturalized; ecologically invasive,0,"Garlic mustard is a fiercely invasive weed that suppresses native vegetation growth in both disturbed and high quality ecosystems.  Garlic mustard is a biennial species which grows heart-shaped leaves that stay low to the ground during the first year of growth.  In the following spring, the garlic mustard will shoot straight up into a tall, slender plant 1-3 feet high, with clusters of small white, four-petal flowers.  Each plant then produces long thin seed pods which expel hundreds of new weed seeds to the neighboring soil.  ","The first-year leaves are mostly basal, triangular to heart shaped, have scalloped edges and give off an odor of garlic when crushed.  The second year plants grow leaves that alternate up a narrow, spindly stalk.   The garlic-like odor is often the best way to distinguish garlic mustard from similar plants. ","Medicinally, garlic mustard is an anti-asthmatic, antiscorbutic, antiseptic, diaphoretic and vermifuge.","The flowers, seeds, leaves, stalk and roots are all edible.

So far, two species of leaf beetles appear to be the best candidates for biological control. Apparently the seeds are little-used by birds and mammalian herbivores rarely bother the foliage, possibly because they're repelled by its garlic-like scent.

The wood from dogwood trees was previously used in the construction of wheels, weaving shuttles, hay forks and machine bearings. This is largely due to the fact that wood from the dogwood tree resists splitting, and wears smoothly and evenly. The wood is strong, dense, durable, and shock resistant. For these reasons, this particular wood is still used in the manufacture of items such as golf club heads, walking canes, tool handles, spindles and mallet heads.
Dogwood roots were used to make dyes. There are several species of dogwood, the roots of which provide different color dyes. Specifically, dogwood roots provide red, black and yellow dyes. 
The beautiful “flowers” on blooming dogwood trees are not technically flowers.  They are actually a type of modified leaf called a bract.  These white, pink or scarlet leaves, which look like petals, surround a yellow center, which is in fact the true flower cluster. The purpose of the bracts is to protect the flower clusters while they are still forming, and they only unfold once the flower clusters open. These bracts also attract pollinating insects to the flower clusters.

Leafy Spurge,Euphorbia virgata,Euphorbia,virgata,Spurge (Euphorbiaceae),Introduced,naturalized; ecologically invasive & noxious weed,0,Leafy spurge is classified as a noxious weed in Wisconsin because of its aggressive growth strategy and ability to compete against and displace native species. It should be irradiated wherever it is found.  Pulling the plant or cultivating the soil typically causes the spurge population to increase as it can grow new plants from tiny fragments of root.  The plant contains a milky latex that is toxic to mammals and causes dermatitis in humans.   Leafy spurge hybridizes readily with other Eurasian spurge species. ,Grows to be 1-2 feet tall and forms dense colonies by reproducing through horizontal rhizomes.  The floral bracts (which appear to be petals or sepals) are yellowish green.  A milky sap is exuded from the leaves and stem when broken (caution: the sap can cause skin irritation). ,Leafy spurge has seldom been used as a medicine due to its poisonous nature.  Large doses have a depressant effect and can be fatal.  The sap is considered carcinogenic in situations of long-term exposure. ,Hazardous. ,"The deep (24 feet!) and extensive root system makes the plant resistant to grazing, cultivation, and herbicides.

The leaves are usually hairless except for sparse hairs along the midvein on the underside. Leaf edges are often wavy and toothless or with a few small teeth.  The leaves often clasp the stem with a pair of small lobes (auricles) at the base. Stems are mostly smooth, green to purplish or spotted purple, sometimes with a waxy bloom, and unbranched except in the flower clusters.  The flowers resemble tiny dandelion flowers.  They form fluffy seed heads about 1-inch in diameter.  The seed is a brown, flattened, oval-elliptic, with a long, slender beak (stalk) at least half as long as the seed body. At the tip of the beak is a tuft of white hairs to carry it off in the wind.
Wild Lettuce can be distinguished from other native lettuces by the color of its flowers, the appearance of its achenes with attached tufts of hairs, and the absence of hairs on its stems and leaves (aside from the scattered non-prickly hairs that may appear along the central veins on the underside of the leaves).
","The white latex contains lactones that can be used as a sedative. Native Americans used an infusion to treat pain, as a stimulant, and for calming the nerves. The milky sap was used topically to treat warts and poison ivy.  ",The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked.  Eating too much can potentially result in a stomach ache and drowsiness.   The leaves of tall lettuce are high in several vitamins.,"One of Charles Darwin’s favorite meals in his elderly age was boiled wild lettuce.
Historically Lactuca has been used to ease anxiety, to induce sleep, and as a mild hypnotic. Its effects are said to be similar to those of opiates. That led to the common name “poor man's opium”.
