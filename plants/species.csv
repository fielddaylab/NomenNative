Alliaria petiolata,Garlic mustard,"It is a herbaceous biennial plant growing from a deeply growing, thin, white taproot that is scented like horseradish.
 In the first year, plants appear as a rosette of green leaves close to 
the ground; these rosettes remain green through the winter and develop 
into mature flowering plants the following spring. Second year plants 
grow from 30–100 cm (rarely to 130 cm) tall. The leaves are stalked, triangular to heart-shaped, 10–15 cm long (of which about half being the petiole) and 5–9 cm broad, with a coarsely toothed margin. The flowers
 are produced in spring and summer in button-like clusters. Each small 
flower has four white petals 4–8 mm long and 2–3 mm broad, arranged in a
 cross shape. The fruit is an erect, slender, four-sided pod 4 to 5.5 cm long,[3] called a silique, green maturing pale grey-brown, containing two rows of small shiny black seeds
 which are released when the pod splits open. A single plant can produce
 hundreds of seeds, which scatter as much as several meters from the 
parent plant.
Depending upon conditions, garlic mustard flowers either self-fertilize or are cross-pollinated by a variety of insects. Self-fertilized
 seeds are genetically identical to the parent plant, enhancing its 
ability to colonize an area where that genotype is suited to thrive.[4]",white,raceme,radial,4,"May, June, July, Aug, Sept",alternate,simple,cordiform,coarsely toothed,branched,round,"hairless, hairy","upright no branches, upright few branches","singular, bunches, patches"

Conyza canadensis,Canada horseweed,"Conyza canadensis (formerly Erigeron canadensis L.) is an annual plant native throughout most of North America and Central America. Common names include Horseweed, Canadian Horseweed, Canadian Fleabane, Coltstail, Marestail and Butterweed.
It is an annual plant growing to 1.5 m tall, with sparsely hairy stems. The leaves are slender, 2–10 cm long and up to 1 cm broad, with a coarsely toothed margin. The flowers are produced in dense inflorescences 1 cm in diameter, with a ring of white or pale purple ray florets and a centre of yellow disc florets.
Horseweed is commonly considered a weed, and in Ohio it has been declared a noxious weed.[1]
 It can be found in fields, meadows, and gardens throughout its native 
range. Horseweed infestations have reduced soybean yields by as much as 
83%. It is an especially problematic weed in no-till agriculture, as it 
is often resistant to glyphosate and other herbicides. Farmers are advised to include 2,4-D or dicamba in a burndown application prior to planting to control horseweed.
Horseweed is much the most common of the alien Conyza species in Britain, and is found from northern Scotland to Cornwall. It is the only one of the British Conyza
 species that grows as a weed of arable land: the others are casuals of 
waste and disturbed ground in towns and by roads and railways. It is not
 invasive of any natural or semi-natural habitats.
C. canadensis can easily be confused with C. sumatrensis, which may grow to a height of 2 m, and the more hairy C. bonariensis which does not exceed 1 m. C. canadensis is distinguished by bracts
 that have a brownish inner surface and no red dot at the tip, and are

It has become an invasive species in many states of the US.
Crown Vetch grows 1 to 2 feet tall and bears small clusters of 1/2-inch pink and white flowers
 from early summer to late fall. The variety Penngift produces mounds of
 pink flowers. Crown Vetch is a tough, aggressive spreading plant that 
will crowd out its neighbors in a show garden but is well suited to a 
sunny bank, where it will grow indefinitely with little maintenance. Its
 deep, tenacious roots and thick, fern-like leaves provide excellent erosion control where it is used as a ground cover.
Crown vetch is toxic to horses because of the presence of nitroglycosides.

Daucus carota,Queen Anne's lace,"Daucus carota is a biennial plant that grows a rosette of leaves in the spring and summer, while building up the stout taproot that stores large amounts of sugars for the plant to flower in the second year.
Soon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct demarcation between the taproot and the hypocotyl.
 The latter is thicker and lacks lateral roots. At the upper end of the 
hypocotyl is the seed leaf. The first true leaf appears about 10–15 days
 after germination. Subsequent leaves, produced from the stem nodes, are
 alternating (with a single leaf attached to a node, and the leaves growing in alternate directions) and compound, and arranged in a spiral. The leaf blades are pinnate.
 As the plant grows, the bases of the cotyledon are pushed apart. The 
stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes
 are not distinct. When the seed stalk elongates, the tip of the stem 
narrows and becomes pointed, extends upward, and becomes a highly 
branched inflorescence. The stems grow to 60–200 cm (20–80 in) tall.  The inflorescence is a compound umbel,
 and each umbel contains several umbellets. The first (primary) umbel 
occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow
 from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and 
even later-flowering umbels. A large primary umbel can contain up to 50 
umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent 
umbels have fewer flowers. Flowers are small and white, sometimes with a
 light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx.",white,umbel,radial,5,"June, July, Aug, Sept",alternate,"pinnate, bipinnate","divided, lobed",lobed,branched,round,hairy,"upright no branches, upright few branches, upright branching","bunches, singular"

Eryngium yuccifolium,Rattlesnake master,"Eryngium yuccifolium (Button snake-root, Rattlesnake Master) is a common herbaceous perennial plant, native to the tallgrass prairies of central and eastern North America, from Minnesota east to Ohio and south to Texas and Florida.
 It grows to 1.8 m tall, with linear leaves 15–100 cm long but only 
1–3 cm broad, with bristly or spiny margins and a sharp tip. The flowers are produced in dense apical umbels
 1–3 cm diameter, each flower greenish-white or bluish-white, 3–4 mm 
diameter. When this plant flowers, pollen matures before stigmas become 
receptive to maximize outcrossing. Rattlesnake master has unusually high
 seed set (close to 90%).[1]
It gets its name because some Native Americans used its root as an antidote for rattlesnake venom. The scientific name was given because its leaves resemble those of yuccas.
 Fibers of Rattlesnake Master have also been found as one of the primary
 materials used in the ancient shoe construction of Midwestern Native 
Americans.[2]

Helianthus grosseserratus,Saw-tooth sunflower,"Helianthus grosseserratus, commonly known as sawtooth sunflower or thick-tooth sunflower[2] , is a perennial sunflower in the family Asteraceae, with a large flowering head (inflorescence).
The plant may reach 3–12 feet (91–366 cm) in height and is found 
along streams, damp prairies and roadsides in the eastern parts of Canada and the USA.[2] It prefers full sun and moist, fertile loamy soil with high organic content.[3]
The lanceolate
 leaves are simple and alternate and may reach 4 to 12 inches (10–30 cm)
 long and from 1 to 4 inches (2–10 cm) wide. The leaf margins are 
sharply toothed (hence the name, sawtooth) to occasionally nearly entire and the tips are pointed.
The head
 (formally composite flower) is 3 to 4 inches (7–10 cm) wide with 
golden-yellow disk flowers that bloom in summer and autumn. The 10-20 
yellow petals are about 1.5 inches (3.81 cm) long. The fruit is a single
 achene within a husk.
Various insects, birds and mammals–including cattle–feed on either the plant or its seeds.[3][4]

Helianthus pauciflorus,Showy sunflower,"Prairie Sunflower can be variable in appearance. With respect to the
flowers, the disk florets are usually reddish brown (maroon), however
sometimes they are yellow in appearance; there are usually 10-15 ray
florets, but sometimes as many as 25. Similarly, the leaves are often
1"" across or less, but sometimes wider. These variations may
be the result of hybridization, or the existence of subspecies that
remain to be identified. This sunflower species can be distinguished
from others by the rough texture of its leaves and stems, the short
stout petioles, and the lanceolate shape of its leaves. In
addition, the floral bracts (phyllaries) are triangular in
shape and more wide than those of most other
sunflowers. Prairie Sunflower is more xerophytic than many
other sunflowers in Illinois, favoring dry upland areas in full
sunlight. Another scientific name for this plant is Helianthus
rigidus, but it is considered obsolete.",yellow,panicle,radial,more,"Aug, Sept",opposite,simple,lanceolate,"coarsely toothed, finely toothed",branched,round,hairless,"upright no branches, upright few branches","patches, singular, bunches"
Heliopsis helianthoides,Ox-eye sunflower,"Heliopsis helianthoides is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, known by the common names smooth oxeye and false sunflower.[1] It is native to eastern North America, including eastern Canada and the eastern United States.[2][3]
This species is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial
 growing 40–150 cm (16–59 in) tall. The toothed leaf blades are oval to 
triangular or lance-shaped and may be smooth or hairy or rough in 
texture. The flowers are produced from midsummer to early autumn (fall).[4] The inflorescence contains one to many composite flowerheads.
 Each head contains yellow ray florets which are generally 2–4 cm long. 
At the center are many yellow to brownish disc florets. The fruit is an achene about 5 mm long.[2]

Hesperis matronalis,Dame's rocket,"Hesperis matronalis grows 100 cm or taller, with multiple 
upright, hairy stems. Typically, the first year of growth produces a 
mound of foliage, and flowering occurs the second year; the plants are 
normally biennials, but a number of races can be short-lived perennials. The plants have showy blooms in early to mid spring. The leaves are alternately arranged on upright stems and lanceolate-shaped; they typically have very short or lack petioles
 and have toothed margins, but sometimes are entire and are widest at 
the base. The foliage has short hairs on the top and bottom surfaces 
that give the leaves a somewhat rough feel. The larger leaves are around
 12 cm long and over 4 cm wide. In early spring, a thick mound of 
low-growing foliage is produced; during flowering the lower parts of the
 stems are generally unbranched and denuded of foliage and the top of 
the blooming plant might have a few branches that end in inflorescences.
The plentiful, fragrant flowers are produced in large, showy, terminal racemes
 that can be 30+ cm tall and elongate as the flowers of the 
inflorescence bloom. When stems have both flowers and fruits, the weight
 sometimes causes the stems to bend. Each flower is large (2 cm across),
 with four petals.
 Flower coloration varies, with different shades of lavender and purple 
most common, but white, pink, and even some flowers with mixed colors 
exist in cultivated forms. A few different double-flowered varieties 
also exist.[2] The four petals are clawed and hairless. The flowers have six stamens in two groups, the four closest to the ovary are longer than the two oppositely positioned. Stigmas are two-lobed. The four sepals are erect and form a mock tube around the claws of the petals and are also colored similarly to the petals.[3]
Some plants may bloom until August, but warm weather greatly shortens
 the duration on each flower's blooming. Seeds are produced in thin 
fruits 5–14 cm long pods, containing two rows of seeds separated by a 
dimple. The fruit are terete and open by way of glabrous valves, constricted between the seeds like a pea pod. Seeds are oblong, 3–4 mm long and 1–1.5 mm wide","purple, pink, white",raceme,radial,4,"May, June, July, Aug, Sept",alternate,simple,"lanceolate, ovate",finely toothed,branched,round,hairy,"upright no branches, upright few branches, upright branching","bunches, singular"

Hypericum perforatum,Common St John's-wort,"Hypericum perforatum is a yellow-flowering, stoloniferous or sarmentose, perennial herb indigenous to Europe.
 It has been introduced to many temperate areas of the world and grows 
wild in many meadows. The herb's common name comes from its traditional 
flowering and harvesting on St John's day, 24 June. The genus name Hypericum is derived from the Greek words hyper (above) and eikon
 (picture), in reference to the plant's traditional use in warding off 
evil by hanging plants over a religious icon in the house during St 
John's day. The species name perforatum
 refers to the presence of small oil glands in the leaves that look like
 windows, which can be seen when they are held against the light.[1]
St John's wort is a perennial plant with extensive, creeping rhizomes.
 Its stems are erect, branched in the upper section, and can grow to 1 m
 high. It has opposing, stalkless, narrow, oblong leaves that are 12 mm 
long or slightly larger. The leaves are yellow-green in color, with 
transparent dots throughout the tissue and occasionally with a few black
 dots on the lower surface.[1] Leaves exhibit obvious translucent dots when held up to the light, giving them a ‘perforated’ appearance, hence the plant's Latin name.
Its flowers measure up to 2.5 cm across, have five petals, and are 
colored bright yellow with conspicuous black dots. The flowers appear in
 broad cymes at the ends of the upper branches, between late spring and early to mid summer. The sepals are pointed, with glandular dots in the tissue. There are many stamens, which are united at the base into three bundles. The pollen grains are ellipsoidal.[1]

Impatiens capensis,Orange jewelweed,"Impatiens capensis, the Orange Jewelweed, Common Jewelweed, Spotted Jewelweed, Spotted Touch-me-not,[1] or Orange Balsam, is an annual plant native to North America. It is common in bottomland soils, ditches, and along creeks, often growing side-by-side with its less common relative, Yellow Jewelweed (I. pallida).
The flowers are orange with a three-lobed corolla; one of the calyx 
lobes is colored similarly to the corolla and forms a hooked conical 
spur at the back of the flower. Plants may also produce non-showy cleistogamous flowers, which do not require cross-pollination.[2] The stems are somewhat translucent, succulent, and have swollen or darkened nodes. The seed pods are pendant and have projectile
 seeds that explode out of the pods when they are lightly touched, if 
ripe, which is where the name 'touch-me-not' comes from. The leaves 
appear to be silver or 'jeweled' when held underwater, which is possibly
 where the jewelweed name comes from. Along with other species of jewelweed it is a traditional remedy for skin rashes, although controlled studies have not shown efficacy for this purpose.",orange,raceme,bilateral,"3, 5","July, Aug, Sept",alternate,simple,"elliptic, ovate",coarsely toothed,branched,"square, ridged",hairless,upright branching,"bunches, singular, patches"

lobes rounded. On older trees, the leaves are generally 5–15 cm long, 
unlobed, cordate at the base and rounded to acuminate at the tip, and 
serrated on the margins. The trees are generally deciduous in temperate regions, but trees grown in tropical regions can be evergreen. The flowers are single-sex catkins;
 male catkins are 2–3.5 cm long, and female catkins 1–2 cm long. Male 
and female flowers are usually on separate trees although they may occur
 on the same tree.[6][7] The fruit
 is 1–2.5 cm long; in the species in the wild it is deep purple, but in 
many cultivated plants it varies from white to pink; it is sweet but 
bland, unlike the more intense flavor of the red mulberry and black mulberry. The seeds are widely dispersed by birds, which eat the fruit and excrete the seeds.[3][4][8]
The white mulberry is scientifically notable for the rapid plant movement involved in pollen release from its catkins. The stamens
 act as catapults, releasing stored elastic energy in just 25 µs. The 
resulting movement is approximately 350 miles per hour (560 km/h), over

Pastinaca sativa,Wild parsnip,"The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root vegetable closely related to the carrot. Parsnips are grown for their fleshy, edible cream-colored taproots. The roots are generally smooth, although lateral roots sometimes form. Most are cylindrical, but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape, which generally tend to be favored by food processors, as they are more resistant to breakage. The plant has an apical meristem that produces a rosette of pinnate leaves. The lower leaves are petiolate, the upper leaves are sessile, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The highly branched floral stem is hollow and grooved, and can grow to more than 150 cm (60 in) tall.[2] Parsnip has a chromosome number of 2n=22.[3]
The wild parsnip from which the modern cultivated varieties were 
derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly
 on chalk and limestone.[4] It is a biennial with a rosette of roughly hairy leaves that has a pungent odor when crushed. The petioles
 are grooved and have sheathed bases. The leaves are once- or 
twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed 
margins; they grow up to 40 cm (16 in) long. The flower stalk develops 
in the second year, growing to a height of 40 to 200 cm (20 to 80 in). 
It is hairy, grooved, hollow (except at the nodes), and sparsely 
branched. It has a few stalkless, single-lobed leaves measuring 5 to 10 
cm (2 to 4 in) long that are arranged in opposite pairs. The yellow 
flowers are in a loose, compound umbel measuring 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) in diameter. There are 6–25 straight pedicels,
 each measuring 2–5 cm (1–2 in) that support the umbellets (secondary 
umbels). The umbels and umbellets usually have no upper or lower bracts. The flowers have tiny or absent sepals, and measure about 3.5 mm. They consist of five yellow petals that are curled inward, five stamens, and one pistil. The fruits, or schizocarps, are oval and flat, with narrow wings and short, spreading styles.

Approximately forty varieties currently are cultivated.[1] It has an extensive Old World distribution extending from North Africa through the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent to Malesia and Australasia.
 The species status in the New World is uncertain: in general, it is 
considered an exotic weed, however, there is evidence that the species 
was in Crawford Lake deposits (Ontario) in 1430-89 AD, suggesting that it reached North America in the pre-Columbian era.[2] It is naturalised elsewhere and in some regions is considered an invasive weed. It has smooth, reddish, mostly prostrate stems and alternate leaves clustered at stem joints and ends. The yellow flowers
 have five regular parts and are up to 6 mm wide. Depending upon 
rainfall, the flowers appear at anytime during the year. The flowers 
open singly at the center of the leaf
 cluster for only a few hours on sunny mornings. Seeds are formed in a 
tiny pod, which opens when the seeds are mature. Purslane has a taproot with fibrous secondary roots and is able to tolerate poor, compacted soils and drought.Portulaca oleracea (Common Purslane, also known as Verdolaga, Pigweed, Little Hogweed, or Pursley, and Moss rose) is an annual succulent in the family Portulacaceae, which may reach 40 cm in height.

Potentilla arguta,Prairie cinquefoil,"Drymocallis arguta, commonly known as the tall cinquefoil, sulphur cinquefoil or sticky cinquefoil, is a perennial plant in the Rosaceae family of flowering plants native to North America. It was formerly included with the typical cinquefoils in the genus Potentilla.
D. arguta is thought to be a protocarnivorous plant. In a 1999 experiment, several plants in the Pacific Northwest were tested for the carnivorous syndrome, using the digestion of proteins as the diagnostic tool to determine which plants appeared to produce protease enzymes capable of breaking down potential prey. D. arguta displayed a capability to digest and absorb the 14C-labeled
 algal protein placed on its sticky trichomes. However, it is not known 
whether the digestive enzymes were produced by the plant itself or 
surface microbes.[1]","white, yellow",cyme,radial,5,"June, July",alternate,pinnate,"divided, ovate, elliptic",coarsely toothed,branched,round,fuzzy,"upright no branches, upright few branches","bunches, singular"

Taraxacum officinale,Common dandelion,"Taraxacum officinale grows from generally unbranched taproots 
and produces one to more than ten stems that are typically 5 to 40 cm 
tall, but sometimes up to 70 cm tall. The stems can be tinted purplish, 
they are upright or lax, and produce flower heads that are held as tall 
or taller than the foliage. The foliage is upright-growing or 
horizontally orientated; the leaves have petioles that are either 
unwinged or narrowly winged. The stems can be glabrous or sparsely 
covered with short hairs. Plants have milky latex
 and the leaves are all basal; each flowering stem lacks bracts and has 
one single flower head. The yellow flower heads lack receptacle bracts 
and all the flowers, which are called florets, are ligulate and bisexual. The fruits are mostly produced by apomixis.[6]
The leaves are 5 to 45 cm long and 1 to 10 cm wide, and are 
oblanceolate, oblong, or obovate in shape, with the bases gradually 
narrowing to the petiole. The leaf margins are typically shallowly lobed
 to deeply lobed and often lacerate or toothed with sharp or dull teeth.[6]
The calyculi (the cuplike bracts that hold the florets) are composed 
of 12 to 18 segments: each segment is reflexed and sometimes glaucous. 
The lanceolate shaped bractlets are in two series, with the apices 
acuminate in shape. The 14- to 25-mm wide involucres are green to dark 
green or brownish-green, with the tips dark gray or purplish. The 
florets number 40 to over 100 per head, having corollas that are yellow 
or orange-yellow in color.
The fruits, called cypselae, range in color from olive-green or 
olive-brown to straw-colored to grayish, they are oblanceoloid in shape 
and 2 to 3 mm long with slender beaks. The fruits have 4 to 12 ribs that
 have sharp edges. The silky pappi,
 which form the parachutes, are white to silver-white in color and 
around 6 mm wide. Plants typically have 24 or 40 pairs of chromosomes 
but some plants have 16 or 32 chromosomes.[7]",yellow,head,radial,more,"Apr, May, June, July, Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov",basal,simple,"lobed, divided, obovate","coarsely toothed, lobed",branched,round,hairless,"upright no branches, upright few branches, upright branching",singular

It is the most common and widely distributed species of Tradescantia in the United States, where it can be found from Massachusetts in the north, west to Minnesota, and south to Texas and Florida. It also has a very small distribution in Canada in extreme southern Ontario near Windsor. Distinguishing features of the species include glaucous
 leaves and stems, leaves forming an acute angle with the stems, sepals 
with hairs lacking glands which are confined to the apex if present at 
all, and a relatively tall habit (up to about 115 cm). Typical habitats 
for the plant include roadsides, along railroads, and in fields and 
thickets. Less typically it can occur in woods, and sometimes along 
streams. As with many species in the genus, it is often forms hybrids
 with related species where they co-occur. More specifically, at least 
nine different species are thought to be capable of forming hybrids with
 T. ohiensis.[1]","blue, purple, pink",cyme,radial,3,"Apr, May, June, July",alternate,simple,linear,entire,parallel,round,hairless,"upright no branches, upright few branches","bunches, singular"

 winter. It has widely spreading rhizomes and stolons, which are bright 
yellow as are the roots. The soft green leaves
 are 3 to 15 cm (1 to 6 in) long and are borne oppositely on an erect 
wiry green stem. The leaves have a strongly serrated margin, a cordate 
base and an acuminate tip with a terminal leaf tooth longer than 
adjacent laterals. It bears small greenish or brownish numerous flowers 
in dense axillary inflorescences. The leaves and stems are very hairy 
with non-stinging hairs and also bear many stinging hairs (trichomes), whose tips come off when touched, transforming the hair into a needle that will inject several chemicals: acetylcholine, histamine, 5-HT (serotonin), moroidin,[2] leukotrienes,[2] and possibly formic acid.[3][4] This mixture of chemical compounds cause a painful sting or paresthesia from which the species derives its common name, as well as the colloquial names burn nettle, burn weed, burn hazel.","white, yellow",panicle,radial,4,"June, July, Aug, Sept",opposite,simple,"cordiform, lanceolate, ovate",coarsely toothed,branched,"ridged, square","prickly, hairy","upright no branches, upright few branches, upright branching","bunches, singular"
Verbascum thapsus,Common mullein,"Verbascum thapsus is a dicotyledonous plant that produces a rosette of leaves in its first year of growth.[2][3]
 The leaves are large, up to 50 cm long. The second year plants normally
 produce a single unbranched stem usually 1–2 m tall. In the East of its
 range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5 m tall.[4] The tall pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers[2] that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes.[4][5] This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n = 36.[6]
On flowering plants the leaves are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between the upper and lower leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50 cm long and 14 cm across (19 inches long and 5 inches wide).[7][8] They become smaller higher up the stem,[2][3] and less strongly decurrent down the stem.[2] The flowering stem is solid and 2–2.5 cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence,[3] usually following damage.[9] After flowering and seed release the stem and fruits usually persist in winter,[10]
 drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, 
ovoid-shaped and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the
 following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.[8]

Verbena urticifolia,White vervain,"Verbena urticifolia (White Vervain) is a herbaceous plant in the vervain family (Verbenaceae). It belongs to the ""true"" vervains of genus Verbena.

The Urtica-like leaves were the reason for the scientifiv name urticifolia.
White Vervain has opposite, simple leaves on thin, rigid, green stems. The leaves look similar to those of Urtica, which is the reason for the plant being named urticifolia. The small flowers are borne in spikes; they open in summer and unusually for this normally bluish-flowered genus are white.
It might be closest to a group that might include such North American species as V. lasiostachys or V. menthifolia, and the Common Vervain (V. officinalis) from Europe. As these, it is diploid with 14 chromosomes altogether. The relationship of the Swamp Verbena (V. hastata) to these species is more enigmatic; its evolution might have involved hybridization with the White Vervain or a related species in the past.[1]",white,"spike, raceme",radial,5,"July, Aug, Sept, Oct",opposite,simple,"lanceolate, ovate","coarsely toothed, finely toothed, doubly toothed",branched,"ridged, square",hairy,"upright no branches, upright few branches","bunches, singular"
